<h1>what got me into cars </h1>
<h2>when i was young i allways was around cars and working on them. <br> As i got older my skills and knowlage expanded
    this helps because now i work on my own cars and mates cars. <br> My skills include roadside repair, fixing major
    parts of an engine and gearbox and basic electics on cars </h2>

<h1>what i love about them </h1>
<h2>i love modifying the cars and making them differant this opens up a whole community of the car culture. <br> we are
    all like a big family and comment on outher cars. We all meet up for organised shows and take pictures of the cars
    and listen to the audio and exhaust of cars as it spits flames.</h2>
